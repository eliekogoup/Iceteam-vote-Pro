# Vercel Deployment Guide

This project is now ready for deployment on Vercel. All build errors have been fixed.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **TypeScript Build Error**: Fixed type inference issue in `src/lib/voting-utils.ts`
2. **Environment Variable Error**: Added fallback values for Supabase client during build
3. **ESLint Configuration**: Added `.eslintrc.json` to prevent lint failures
4. **Next.js Configuration**: Added `next.config.js` for optimal Vercel deployment

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `eliekogoup/Iceteam-vote-Pro`

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Add these environment variables in Vercel project settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

**Where to find these values:**
- Log into your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com
- Go to Project Settings > API
- Copy the Project URL and API keys

### 3. Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and build your project
3. Your app will be live at `your-project.vercel.app`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Make sure to set all three environment variables before deploying
- **Service Role Key**: Keep this secret - never expose it in client-side code
- **Build Time**: First deployment may take 2-3 minutes to complete

## üîç Verify Deployment

After deployment, check:
1. Homepage loads correctly
2. Login page works
3. Admin pages are accessible (after login)
4. No console errors in browser

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
2. Verify your Supabase project is running
3. Check Vercel build logs for any errors
4. Ensure database tables are created in Supabase (see README-UPDATED.md)

**Note**: The application uses placeholder values during build time to prevent errors. Actual Supabase connections only happen at runtime with your configured environment variables.
